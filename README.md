# Playground

Small experiments and tinkerings

1. `Gemini_Search_Testing.ipynb`: Adding google search and web scraping to gemini. Built this for a hackthon specifically targeted at getting info about college courses but generic interface can be easily exposed to instruct agent to follow any required objective.

2. `World_Bank_Data.ipynb`: Playing around with World Bank data.
